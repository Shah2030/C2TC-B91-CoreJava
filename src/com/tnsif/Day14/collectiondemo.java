/*
 * Collection: it is group of objects
 * Collection frame work provides a set of standerd utility class to manage collections
 * Framework consists of:{classes and methods} and parts are:
 * Core interface
 * concurrent implication
 * Algorithm such as search and sort
 * 
 * iterable - Collection - {List(ArrayList, linkedList, Vector, Stack), set(HashsetSLinkedHashSet), Queue(priority queue, )}
 * 
 * List Interface: ordered or sequential collection of list
 * 0 based index
 * using index values can be accessed
 * Insertion and removal from specific position
 * may contain duplicate elements
 * multiple null elements
 * dynamic in nature
 * Non Synchronized
 * 
 * ArrayList: 
 * 
 * LinkedList: 
 * elements are inter-connected
 * used doubly linked list to store elements
 * 
 * 
 * Methods:
	int size(): to get the number of elements in the list.
	boolean isEmpty(): to check if list is empty or not.
	boolean contains(Object o): Returns true if this list contains the specified element.
	Iterator<E> iterator(): Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.
	Object[] toArray(): Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence
	boolean add(E e): Appends the specified element to the end of this list.
	boolean remove(Object o): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list.
	boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c): Retains only the elements in this list that are contained in the specified collection.
	void clear(): Removes all the elements from the list.
	E get(int index): Returns the element at the specified position in the list.
