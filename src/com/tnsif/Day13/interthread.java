 * Inter Thread Communication: it is a technique through which multiple threads communicate with each other
 * By reducing CPU idle time cycles thread communicate with each other
 * CUP idle time is a process in which CPU cycles are not wasted
 * Achieved through final methods: 
 * wait(): notifies the current thread to give the monitor (lock) and go to 
 * notify(): wakes up the single thread that called wait() on the same obj
 * notifyAll(): wake up all the threads that called wait() n same obj
